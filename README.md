# The Lift #
The Lift is an educational task, meant to solve a problem optimally and teach me some Ruby.

### Task ###
The task is to have a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) implementation of [The Lift](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58905bfa1decb981da00009e/ruby) problem.

* A multi-floor building has a Lift in it.
* People are queued on different floors waiting for the Lift.
* Some people want to go up. Some people want to go down.
* The floor they want to go to is represented by a number (i.e. when they enter the Lift this is the button they will press)

### Setup ###

* Windows 10 OS
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE
* [Ruby Rubocop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=misogi.ruby-rubocop) Style Cop
